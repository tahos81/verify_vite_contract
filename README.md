# verify_vite_contract
api for vite smart contract verification

It is not functional sadly. I've been working on it for a week but I could not make it work. Javascript is not a language I know much about and I dont have much experience with web development.
I had a lot of fun trying to making it work and learned a lot. Although Javascript is a weakness of mine I believe I can excel in solidityPP development if I get hired and be an excellent smart contract developer.
I can dedicate a lot of hours of my day to this job, and I try a lot even if something is hard for me, I basically learned javascript from scratch for this bounty.
